## Physical Design using OpenLANE & Sky130 PDK

## üìò Project Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the physical design flow, leveraging the OpenLane toolchain with the Sky130 open-source Process Design Kit (PDK). Developed as part of the Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Workshop by VLSI System Design Corporation, this project delivers hands-on experience in chip design, from initial Register Transfer Level (RTL) code to the final GDSII manufacturing file.

OpenLane is a robust, open-source automation framework that transforms RTL designs into GDSII layouts. It integrates essential tools such as Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, Netgen, Fault, and OpenPhySyn, ensuring efficient and automated generation of clean, manufacturable chip layouts without the need for manual intervention. The flow is specifically optimized for the Skywater 130nm PDK, making it ideal for developing both hard macros and complete chips.

# DAY-1
# Inception-of-Open-source-EDA,OpenLane-and-Sky130-PDK

we explore the fundamental physical elements of an integrated circuit (IC) : 

**Package, Chip, Pads, Core, Die, and IPs** : 
- The QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-lead) package is a surface-mounted IC package with 48 pins used to connect the chip to the outside world.

- Inside the package is the die, the actual silicon chip where transistors are fabricated.

- The core is the functional part of the die where the logic (e.g., processor, memory) is implemented.

- Surrounding the core are pads, which act as electrical contact points for interfacing signals from the core to the pins on the package.
  
- The chip as a whole includes the die, package, and connections.

The core of the chip will contain two types of blocks:

**Foundry IP Blocks** (e.g. ADC, DAC, PLL, and SRAM) = blocks which requires some amount of intelligent techniques to build which can only be designed by foundries.

**Macro blocks** (e.g. RISC-V SOC and SPI) = pure digital logic blocks compared to IP's which might require some analog parts.

## Introduction to RISC-V

- RISC-V stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing ‚Äì Version 5 and is designed with simplicity and modularity in mind.

- Unlike proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86, RISC-V is open, meaning anyone can implement or modify it freely.

- The architecture consists of a base integer set and optional extensions (e.g., for multiplication, atomic operations, floating point).

- RISC-V is ideal for education, research, and industrial design due to its transparency and scalability.

## Simplified RTL to GDSII Flow 

*Synthesis*

The Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, typically written in Verilog or VHDL, is translated into a gate-level netlist. This netlist is composed of logic gates and components from a pre-defined standard cell library. These cells have fixed sizes and electrical characteristics, provided by the Process Design Kit (PDK). During synthesis, optimizations such as constant propagation, logic simplification, and technology mapping are performed to ensure an area-efficient and logically equivalent design.

*Floor Planning and Power Planning*

This step involves defining the physical layout of the chip, including the die area, core area, margins, and reserved regions for IP blocks or macros. Floorplanning also includes decisions on I/O pin placement and defining power domains.
In power planning, a Power Distribution Network (PDN) is created to deliver clean power across the chip. The power rails and straps are usually placed on upper metal layers since they are thicker and have lower resistance, which helps reduce IR drop and ensures reliable power delivery.

*Placement*

Placement determines the exact physical location of standard cells within the defined floorplan. This process occurs in two phases:

- Global Placement: Estimates optimal positions to reduce wirelength and congestion, but may not obey all design rules.

- Detailed Placement: Adjusts the global result to ensure legal placement while minimizing additional wirelength or timing penalties.

*Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)*

A clock tree is built to distribute the clock signal to all sequential elements (flip-flops) in the design. Since all flip-flops must receive the clock signal simultaneously to avoid timing violations like skew and jitter, structures such as H-trees or X-trees are used. CTS also buffers the clock signal and ensures balanced timing paths across different regions.

*Routing*

Routing connects the logically associated pins (nets) across the placed cells using horizontal and vertical metal layers defined in the PDK.

- Global Routing identifies approximate routing paths.

- Detailed Routing determines exact wiring with specific tracks, vias, and metal layers.
 
- The Sky130 PDK provides six metal layers, each with defined widths, spacings, pitches, and via rules to guide the router for legal and             manufacturable connections.

*Verification Before Sign-off*

Before the final design is ready for fabrication, several verification steps are required:

- DRC (Design Rule Check): Ensures the physical layout complies with all foundry-imposed rules like minimum spacing, width, enclosure, etc.

- LVS (Layout Versus Schematic): Compares the layout netlist against the schematic/netlist from the synthesis phase to confirm logical equivalence.

- Timing Analysis: Static Timing Analysis (STA) verifies that all setup and hold time constraints are satisfied across all paths and corners         (process, voltage, temperature).
The final Result is [GDSII file format.](https://anysilicon.com/semipedia/gdsii/)

RTL to GDSII flow : [Openlane](https://efabless.com/openlane)

## OpenLane Flow

<img width="848" height="=500" alt="182759711-6b9352ec-7652-4589-af31-53a409eb2830" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3cdde11-73e1-496e-9486-3d02f62ff65d"/>


OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow that utilizes various components such as OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, and custom scripts for design exploration and optimization.

The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL down to GDSII. OpenLane Interactive Mode Commands include a variety of functions such as setting the current netlist, running logic verification, setting the current def file, preparing lef files, preparing a liberty file, generating an exclude list file, sourcing configurations, specifying a path to save config_in.tcl, preparing a run, specifying a design folder, overwriting an existing run, specifying a path to save the run, specifying a name for a specific run, creating a tcl configuration file for a design, setting the verilog source code file, specifying the design's configuration file, setting a verbose output level, generating a padframe, saving views of a given run, changing save paths for various file types, labeling pins of a macro def, generating a verilog netlist from a def file, creating an obstruction, setting tracks on a layer, extracting core dimensions, running SPEF extraction and Static Timing Analysis, running antenna checks, saving environment variables, running OpenSTA timing analysis, checking for unmapped cells, checking for assign statements, and checking if the LEF was properly read.

- *Antenna Rules Violation* : long wire segments will act as antennna and will accumulate charges, this might damage the connected transistor gates. Solution is to either use bridging or antenna diode insertion to leak away the charges.  

### OpenLane Directory Hierarchy:

``` 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OOpenLane             -> directory where the tool can be invoked (run docker first)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ designs          -> All designs must be extracted from this folder
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ picorv32a -> Design used as case study for this workshop
‚îÇ   |   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
|   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pdks                 -> contains pdk related files 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skywater-pdk     -> all Skywater 130nm PDKs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ open-pdks        -> contains scripts that makes the commerical PDK (which is normally just compatible to commercial tools) to also be compatible with the open-source EDA tool
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sky130A          -> pdk variant made especially compatible for open-source tools
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libs.ref  -> files specific to node process (timing lib, cell lef, tech lef) for example is `sky130_fd_sc_hd` (Sky130nm Foundry Standard Cell High Density)  
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libs.tech -> files specific for the tool (klayout,netgen,magic...) 
```

Inside a specific design folder contains a `config.tcl` which overrides the default settings on OpenLANE. These configurations are specific to a design (e.g. clock period, clock port, verilog files...). The priority order for the OpenLANE settings:
1. sky130_xxxxx_config.tcl in `OpenLane/designs/[design]/`
2. config.tcl in `OpenLane/designs/[design]/`
3. Default values in `OpenLane/configuration/`



### Lab [Day 1] - Determine Flip-flop Ratio:
The task is to find the flip-flop ratio ratio for the design `picorv32a`. This is the ratio of the number of flip flops to the total number of cells. For the OpenLane installation, the steps are very straight forward and can be found on the [OpenLane repo](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane).

**1. Run OpenLANE:**
 - `$ make mount` = Open the docker platform inside the `openlane/`
 - `% flow.tcl -interactive` = run script for automating the whole RTL to GDSII flow but in step by step `-interactive` mode
 - `% package require openlane 0.9` == retrives all dependencies for running v0.9 of OpenLANE  
![FScreenshot](https://github.com/Dhanushgp-Sahyadri-ECE/Digital-VLSI-SoC-Openlane-sky130A/blob/main/Day-1/Screenshot%202025-07-31%20123701.png?raw=true)


 
**2. Design Setup Stage:**
 - `% prep -design picorv32a` = Setup the filesystem where the OpenLANE tools can dump the outputs. This also creates a `run/` folder inside the specific design directory which contains the command log files, results, and the reports dump by each tools. These folders will be empty for now except for lef files generated by this design setup stage. This merged the [cell LEF files](https://teamvlsi.com/2020/05/lef-lef-file-in-asic-design.html) `.lef` and [technology LEF files](https://teamvlsi.com/2020/05/lef-lef-file-in-asic-design.html) `.tlef` generating `merged.nom.lef` inside `run/tmp/`

**3. Run synthesis:**
 - `% run_synthesis` = Run yosys RTL synthesis, ABC scripts (for technology mapping), and OpenSTA.  
 
![Flip-Flop Ratio Formula](https://github.com/Dhanushgp-Sahyadri-ECE/Digital-VLSI-SoC-Openlane-sky130A/blob/main/Day-1/flipflop-ratio.jpg?raw=true)



**The flipflop ratio is (number of flip flops)/(total number of cells) is 1613/14876 = 0.10843. Or 10.843%**

#### Slack 

refers to the difference between the required arrival time and the actual arrival time of a signal. If the signal arrives earlier than required, it's called positive slack, indicating the design meets timing. If it arrives later, it's negative slack, meaning a timing violation has occurred. Positive slack is desirable, while negative slack must be fixed to ensure reliable circuit operation.

In Order to fix negetive slack we change the clock period to ```55.00``` in ```sky130_xxxxx_config.tcl```

# Day 2 
# Good Floorplan vs Bad Floorplan and Introduction to Library Cells

#### Floorplan

The floorplanning process begins with determining the core and die dimensions, where the core is the central region where standard logic cells are placed. The size of the core depends on the standard cell dimensions present in the netlist, and its utilization factor‚Äîtypically between 0.5 and 0.6‚Äîrepresents the ratio of the netlist area to the total core area, leaving enough space for routing and additional filler or buffer cells. Another important metric is the aspect ratio, calculated as height divided by width; an aspect ratio of 1 indicates a square-shaped core, which is often ideal for routing efficiency.

Next, preplaced cells, which include complex and reusable IP blocks like memories or clock-gating cells, are defined by the user and fixed prior to the automated placement and routing steps. These cells cannot be moved by tools afterward. To ensure power integrity, decoupling capacitors are placed near preplaced cells to stabilize the local voltage supply, especially in the presence of long power lines where resistance and inductance can cause IR drop. These capacitors provide localized charge during fast switching events, keeping the voltage within acceptable noise margins.

However, decoupling capacitors alone are not enough for stable power delivery across the entire chip. To combat issues like ground bounce (from many cells switching to logic 0) and voltage droop (from simultaneous switching to logic 1), a robust power mesh is employed. This mesh distributes VDD and VSS taps uniformly across the chip to ensure consistent current flow and reduce voltage fluctuations.

Finally, pin placement is performed, where I/O ports are positioned between the core and the die boundary based on the location of the logic blocks they connect to. Clock pins are given wider tracks to reduce resistance and ensure reliable clock distribution across the design. Additionally, logical cell placement blockages are defined in areas around the pins to prevent standard cells from being placed over or too close to pin locations, which ensures successful routing and prevents congestion near the die edge.


#### Placement

Placement in digital ASIC design begins with netlist binding, where the logical representation of a circuit is mapped to physical standard cell shapes from a library. Each gate, flip-flop, or logic element in the synthesized netlist is associated with a predefined layout view from the standard cell library. During the initial placement phase, these mapped cells are positioned within the core area of the chip, with key emphasis on proximity to I/O pins for minimizing signal delays. Critical signal paths, such as those between flip-flops (e.g., FF1 to FF2), are shortened by placing related components closer together, and buffer insertion may be used for better signal integrity. Wire-length and capacitance estimates further influence this phase to optimize for performance metrics like timing, power, and noise. Final placement optimization then refines this layout by considering real design constraints, still assuming an ideal clock, and aims to minimize path delays and power usage. At this point, the design has transitioned from logical mapping and floorplanning to a physical representation, with standard cell rows prepared and components now optimally placed for routing.

# Day 3
# Design a Library Cell using Magic Layout and Ngspice Characterization

#### Designing a Library Cell 

  

  
  
#### Follow these steps for simulation in ngspice :
 
  1. Source the circuit file in Ngspice using source <file_name>.cir.
  2. Execute the simulations using the run command.
  3. Use setplot to prepare for plotting.
  4. For DC analysis (as indicated in the .cir file), use dc1 to prepare the DC plot.
  5. Display available vectors using display.
  6. Plot specific vectors, e.g., plot vout vs vin, to visualize the circuit behavior.


#### 16-Mask CMOS Process 
The 16-mask CMOS process for fabricating an *inverter* starts with selecting a `P-type Si wafer` (5‚Äì50 Œ©¬∑cm, ‚ü®100‚ü© orientation), ensuring substrate doping is less than well doping. Active regions are isolated using the `LOCOS` technique: `Mask 1` patterns photoresist to protect transistor areas, with an `Si‚ÇÉN‚ÇÑ` layer (~80nm) blocking oxidation and field oxide growing (~1¬µm) in exposed regions. `N-well` formation for PMOS uses `Mask 2` and a phosphorus implant @400 keV, while `P-well` formation for NMOS uses `Mask 3` with a boron implant @200 keV followed by drive-in diffusion. Threshold voltage is adjusted using `Mask 4/5` with boron (NMOS) and arsenic (PMOS) implants. A high-quality gate oxide (~10nm SiO‚ÇÇ) is grown, and `Mask 6` defines the poly-Si gate. Lightly Doped Drain (LDD) structures are formed to reduce short-channel effects: `Mask 7` and `Mask 8` introduce `N‚Åª` (Phosphorus for NMOS) and `P‚Åª` (Boron for PMOS) implants, with `SiO‚ÇÇ` sidewall spacers added via deposition and anisotropic etch. Source and drain formation uses `Mask 9` and `Mask 10` for `N‚Å∫` (Arsenic) and `P‚Å∫` (Boron) implants respectively, with a screen oxide to prevent channeling. Contacts and local interconnects are formed by sputtering Ti, followed by RTA at 600‚Äì700¬∞C to form `TiSi‚ÇÇ` at gates and `TiN` for routing, then `Mask 11` defines first-layer contacts. Metallization involves PSG deposition, CMP, via etching (`Mask 12/14`), and metal deposition (`Mask 13/15`) with Aluminum or Tungsten, followed by `Mask 16` for top-layer contact opening. Key insights: `PMOS width > NMOS` (2‚Äì3√ó) for current drive matching, `LDD` and spacers mitigate leakage and hot-carrier effects, `TiSi‚ÇÇ` reduces gate resistance, and `TiN` improves local routing. The 16 masks span well doping, isolation, threshold control, gates, contacts, and interconnects.

The current sky130A.tech file only includes spacing rules for:

- n-poly resistor to n-diffusion

- p-poly resistor to p-diffusion

We are now adding two new critical spacing rules (highlighted in green):

- Left rule: Spacing between n-poly resistor and regular poly (non-resistor)

- Right rule: Spacing between p-poly resistor and regular poly (non-resistor)

These additions ensure proper isolation between resistor and non-resistor poly layers in the design

To apply the new poly resistor spacing rules:

Run ```tech load sky130A.tech``` to update the rules.

Use ```drc check``` ‚Äì violations appear as white dots on poly layers.

Inspect each violation with ```drc find```

New rules cover:

n-poly ‚Üî poly spacing

p-poly ‚Üî poly spacing

# DAY 4 
# Pre-layout Timing Analysis and Importance of Good Clock Tree 

## Theory

#### Delay Table

To minimize clock skew between endpoints of a clock tree (preventing signal arrival at different times):

- Equal capacitive load: Buffers at the same level must drive identical capacitive loads to ensure uniform timing delay (latency).

- Uniform buffer sizing: Buffers on the same level must be the same size, as differing sizes lead to varying W/L ratios, resistances, and RC constants‚Äîresulting in    inconsistent delays.

To minimize clock skew in a clock tree distribution network, buffers at the same hierarchical level must maintain identical capacitive loads and uniform buffer sizes to ensure consistent propagation delays across all branches. While different levels may employ varying buffer sizes and drive different capacitive loads, the symmetric matching of these characteristics within each level guarantees balanced cumulative delays along all clock paths, effectively eliminating skew. The timing behavior of these buffer cells is characterized through delay tables in liberty files, where the primary delay component - output slew - is determined by both the output capacitive load and input transition time. This input transition time itself depends on the preceding buffer's output characteristics and its own transition delay properties, creating a cascaded timing relationship that must be carefully modeled for accurate skew prediction and control.

<img width="1166" height="635" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-30 223725" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15e6a690-8f95-41c5-8027-a0e04d836538" />

#### Timing Analysis (using Ideal Clocks)

During pre-layout static timing analysis (STA), the verification is performed using ideal clock models that do not yet account for the physical implementation effects. At this stage, the analysis excludes both clock buffer delays and net delays caused by RC parasitics, as the complete routing information is not yet available. Instead, wire delay estimates are derived from the process design kit (PDK) library wire models, which provide approximate interconnect characteristics based on technology parameters. This idealized approach enables early timing verification before physical implementation, but requires subsequent post-layout STA to validate timing with actual buffer insertion and extracted parasitic RC values from the final layout.

#### Clock Tree Synthesis Stage

When constructing a clock tree, three critical parameters must be addressed: (1) Clock skew minimization requires balanced clock tree structures that ensure equal wire lengths and matching delays to all endpoints, guaranteeing synchronous signal arrival. (2) Clock signal integrity demands careful slew rate control through specialized clock buffers that maintain symmetrical rise/fall times, compensating for RC degradation along interconnect routes. (3) Crosstalk prevention necessitates strategic shielding of clock nets, typically achieved by routing power (VDD) or ground lines adjacent to clock signals to break parasitic coupling capacitances with neighboring aggressor nets; this shielding methodology may also be applied to other timing-critical signal paths. Together, these techniques ensure robust clock distribution with minimal timing variation, proper signal quality, and reduced noise coupling throughout the clock network.
